# Hello World

This demo contains several handlers that aim to show you the ropes. To get started, [visit the documentation on readthedocs](http://tornado-json.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for a walkthrough of creating the app and setting up the single `HelloWorldHandler`. After you're done that, see the rest of the handlers in `helloworld.api`; they're annotated with comments explaining.

## Diving In

If you just want to run some code, and see things happen...

```
python helloworld.py
```

Take a look through `API_Documentation.md` for auto-generated API documentation, and see `helloworld.api` for more example code.
